# To-Do-List.Vanilla-JS
A better version of Deved's "To-Do List". Link to his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ .
Dev Ed's version was pretty good and working except when you click on the check button and refresh the page, the check disappears.
So I added the feature needed to fix it, I'm sure the code can be more neat which I'll make sure to work on  later.
